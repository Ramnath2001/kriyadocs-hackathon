# kriyadocs-hackathon

This is my solution for the hackathon conducted by kriyadocs. The problem statement was to create an application that takes a pdf (generated from an application) as input and certifies if
the pdf is valid. To certify that the pdf is valid, it should satisfy a few given rules.

I used python to solve the problem with the help of additional libraries like pymupdf and flask
